An image classification system with 9 classes. Classifies images of 9 different animals. The dataset used was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10 The dataset was renamed, cleaned of outliers manually and since the dataset was not balanced, it was undersampled to achieve balance between the classes. Several preprocessing methods were performed on the dataset to get it ready for input into the neural network. At first, 224 by 224 pixels was the standard size for all photos. Ensuring that the images are compatible with the network architecture and that the network can process each image consistently depended on this standardization. Techniques for data augmentation were used to increase the diversity of the dataset and strengthen the generalization capacity of the model. Random scaling within the range of 0.9 to 1.1, random reflections along the X and Y axes, and random rotations between -20 and 20 degrees were all included in the augmentation. By simulating variations that the model might face in actual situations, these strategies strengthen the model. Following that, the dataset was divided into three subsets: testing, validation, and training. The validation set was used to adjust hyperparameters and avoid overfitting, the test set was used to assess the model's final performance, and the training set was used to determine the model's parameters.
